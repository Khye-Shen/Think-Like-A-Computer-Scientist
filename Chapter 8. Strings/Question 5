# Assign to a variable in your program a triple-quoted string that contains your favourite paragraph of text — perhaps a poem, a speech, instructions to bake a cake, some inspirational verses, etc.

#Write a function which removes all punctuation from the string, breaks the string into a list of words, and counts the number of words in your text that contain the letter “e”. Your program should print an analysis of the text like this:

text = """You make me feel special!
No matter how the world brings me down,
Even when hurtful words stab me,
I smile again cuz you're there,
That's what you do...
*Again, I feel special!!!*
*One moment I feel like, I'm nothing at all,*
*Like no one would notice If I were gone,*
*But then when I hear you calling me,
*I feel loved, I feel so special ;-;* """

import string

def text_analysis(text):
    count = 0
    without_punct = ""


    for letter in text:
        if letter not in string.punctuation:
            without_punct += letter

    split = without_punct.split()

    for i in range(len(split)):
        if split[i].find("e") != -1:
            count += 1

    return (without_punct, count, len(split), split)

t = text_analysis(text)
print(t)

print(""" Your text contains {0} words, of which {1} ({2}%) contains an "e" """.format(t[2], t[1], float(t[1])/float(t[2]) * 100))
