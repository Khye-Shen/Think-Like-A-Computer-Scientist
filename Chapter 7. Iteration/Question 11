#Revisit the drunk pirate problem from the exercises in chapter 3. This time, the drunk pirate makes a turn, and then takes some steps forward, and repeats this. Our social science student now records pairs of data: the angle of each turn, and the number of steps taken after the turn. Her experimental data is [(160, 20), (-43, 10), (270, 8), (-43, 12)]. Use a turtle to draw the path taken by our drunk friend.

import turtle

t = turtle.Turtle()

movement = [(160, 20), (-43, 10), (270, 8), (-43, 12)]



for i in range(len(movement)):
    angle = movement[i]
    t.right((movement[i])[0])
    t.forward((movement[i])[1])

turtle.done()
